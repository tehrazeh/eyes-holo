# Eyes Holo is about Dota 2 heroes and items

It uses Opendota API to retrieve some nifty information about all heroes and items in
the game of Dota 2. Here is the link, check it out: https://eyes-holo.vercel.app/

## What I used

Besides Opendota API, I used React and JavaScript to handle logic, Axios to handle requests, SCSS modules for painting, and Redux Toolkit for state management. It has some basic, yet useful custom hooks such as debounce, a width checker to hide some details for small screens, and a hook that takes care of an extra get request for hero lore.


## Updates

I never abandon my applications. I constantly improve as a developer and always comeback to make them more efficient, user-friendly, and of course, add some features and content. Maybe I am making an update right now...
